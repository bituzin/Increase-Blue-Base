# Increase Blue Base
*Working DApp: 
Simple, Immutable, Ever-Increasing Counter Smart Contract

**Solidity 0.8.0+** • **License: MIT**

Deployed and Verified on **Base** `0x78776b0d6185D97Ca9a9A822bf1E192e3B44307f`

## 📖 Overview
Increase Blue is an extremely simple yet powerful smart contract that implements a permanently increasing counter on the Base blockchain. Once deployed, the counter can only move forward - it can never be decreased, reset, or modified by anyone.

## 🎯 Key Features
✅ **Only Increases** - Single `increment()` function that adds +1  
❌ **No Decrease** - Absolutely no way to subtract from the counter  
❌ **No Reset** - Counter can never return to zero  
❌ **No Owner** - No administrative privileges or special access  
❌ **No Parameters** - Fixed +1 increment, no arbitrary values  
🔒 **Immutable** - Once deployed, behavior cannot be changed  
📊 **Full History** - Complete record of every increase with timestamps  
🔍 **Transparent** - All transactions publicly verifiable on BaseScan  

20/10.2025 Update: Added Time Tracking Features (baseBlueCounter v0.2.sol)

1. lastIncrementTime (public variable)
Purpose: Tracks the exact timestamp of the last counter increment
Returns: Unix timestamp (uint256) of when the counter was last increased
Usage: Directly accessible public variable showing when the last interaction occurred

2. getTimeSinceLastIncrement() (public view function)
Purpose: Calculates real-time duration since the last increment
Returns: Number of seconds (uint256) elapsed since last increase
Usage: Provides live countdown showing how long the counter has been idle

Benefits:
📊 Real-time monitoring - See exactly when the counter was last used
⏰ Activity tracking - Monitor community engagement patterns
🔄 Live updates - Frontend can display "X seconds/minutes since last increase"
📈 Analytics ready - Enables time-based statistics and visualizations


## 📦 Contract Interface
```solidity
// ONLY function that modifies state
function increment() public

// View current count
function getCount() public view returns (uint256)

// Get complete increase history
function getIncreaseHistory() public view returns (IncreaseRecord[] memory)

// Get total number of increases
function getIncreaseHistoryCount() public view returns (uint256)

// Get specific increase record
function getIncreaseRecord(uint256 index) public view returns (IncreaseRecord memory)
